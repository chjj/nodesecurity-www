## Overview

Marked 0.3.3 and earlier is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) when certain types of input are passed in to be parsed.

"The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time." [1]

## Recommendation:

As there is no patch available we recommend switching to another markdown parser or if you are able, help out the project by submitting a patch.
