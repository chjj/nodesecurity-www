        h3 SECURITY.md
        p One reason 0day vulnerabilities get released without fixes being available is because of ineffective communication.
        p A SECURITY.md file communicates with the users of your project how you like to have security issues reported to you and set expectations about timelines for fixes and communication with the finder.
        p Examples security.md files

        h3 Self Disclosure
        p When you fix a security issue within one of your modules it's important to self disclose this issue to the Node Security Project. That way we can issue an advisory and disseminate that information via a communication channels and tools ensuring that your users update as soon as possible.

        h3 Write for other developers
        p Whenever you encounter a security challenge that you have to solve within your application you should write a blog post, especially if you weren't able to find a good article. Then tell us about it so we can link to it!
